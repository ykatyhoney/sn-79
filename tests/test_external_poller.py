"""Orchestration tests for MarketEngine's background external-order poller.

The poller decouples the data-service fetch+verify from receive(): a background
task fills _external_buffer via _fetch_external_orders(), and receive() drains it
with no await. These tests cover only that NEW mechanism (buffer fill, atomic
drain, idempotent start, cancel-on-stop, survives a fetch error) with a stub
_fetch_external_orders, so they are deterministic and offline. The wire fetch and
downstream injection are unchanged and validated on the live validator.
