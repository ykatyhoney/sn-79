"""Tests for GenTRX gradient scoring publication.

Pins the contract for `_deliver_scores` / `_latest_scores`:

  - Every UID with an assignment in the current round appears in the
    published payload, including miners that did not submit a gradient.
  - Non-submitters appear with `score=0.0` and `accepted=False`, even
    when 0.0 happens to exceed `min_score`.
  - Submitters carry the stamped score; `accepted` follows the threshold.
  - A round where nobody submits still publishes a fresh payload for
    the current round; the previous payload does not stick around.
  - Across rounds, a miner that stops submitting drops to 0 within one
    round (the bug this suite was written to catch).

These tests sidestep torch by replacing `_score_and_aggregate` on the
instance with a stub that reads pre-stamped `_score` off each
submitter's assignment and calls `_deliver_scores` directly.
