Arbitrageur agent: take the "gifts", faster than the farm.

A farm can pump a few "winner" UIDs by having its own "puppet" UIDs post orders
priced *through* fair value and letting the winner take them. Those off-market
resting orders are free money for whoever crosses to them first. This agent is a
lean, market-data-only arbitrageur: each round it finds a best ask trading BELOW a
robust fair estimate (or a best bid ABOVE it) and immediately crosses with a
marketable IOC order to take it.

Why this matters: if enough well-optimised copies of this run, the farm can no
longer *reliably* hand its winners those gifts — a competing arbitrageur snaps
them up first, so the value leaks to honest miners and the pump stops paying. It
changes nothing in the background market; it just competes, which is the point of
the subnet.

SPEED IS THE STRATEGY. The validator delays each response in simulation time by an
exponential function of your wall-clock response time (min 10 ms at ~instant, up
to 1 s near the 3 s timeout). Two agents targeting the same gift are ordered by
that delay, so the faster responder takes it. The farm's winners on mainnet
respond in ~0.16 s at the fastest (~12 ms sim-delay); to beat them you must get
your *total* round-trip below ~0.15 s — realistically ~0.05–0.10 s — via minimal
per-round compute (this agent is O(books) with a handful of comparisons; keep it
that way) and optimised / co-located networking. Below ~0.3 s you already beat
~90% of their responses; the last few ms is where the fastest gifts are won.

Params (via --agent.params):
  edge        min fractional mispricing to act on (default 0.004 = 0.4%)
  fair_alpha  EMA weight on the current mid for the fair estimate (default 0.05)
  max_take    base units taken per hit (default 1.0)
  cross_frac  how far to cross past the target to guarantee the fill (default 0.001)
