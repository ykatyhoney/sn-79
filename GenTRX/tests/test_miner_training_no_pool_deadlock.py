Miner training pipeline — pool-shutdown must not deadlock on stuck downloads.

Regression for the observed live bug (2026-07-02): benchmark miner on a
remote R2-backed deployment received 27 assignments over ~2 hours but
never produced a training log line. Root cause:
`_download_and_train_background` used `with ThreadPoolExecutor(...) as pool:`.
That context manager calls `pool.shutdown(wait=True)` on exit, blocking
forever if any submitted download future is stuck in a boto3 socket read
(same class of hang as `_restore_written_parquets` on the gradient server
last week).

Because the outer thread never returns, its `finally` block never sets
`training_in_progress = False`, so `_kick_training` early-returns on every
subsequent assignment. Symptom: pending grows unbounded, no training.

Fix: manual pool management with `pool.shutdown(wait=False)` and a
self-kick in the finally so assignments queued during a run drain even if
no fresh submit arrives.

Tests:
  1. A stuck download future does NOT wedge the pool shutdown — the
     wrapper returns promptly and `training_in_progress` flips back.
  2. Self-kick fires when assignments accumulated during training.
