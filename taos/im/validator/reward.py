    Calculate normalized P&L score using per-book daily returns with median aggregation.
    
    This function measures absolute profitability per book:
    - Calculates daily return for EACH book independently
    - Uses per-book capital (miner_wealth, which is already per-book) as reference
    - Allows up to max_inactive_books to have zero P&L without penalty
    - Excess inactive books contribute 0.0 to the median calculation
    - Takes MEDIAN across scored books (consistent with Kappa methodology)
    - Maps to [-0.5, 0.5] with 0.0 as neutral (breakeven)
    
    Scoring Philosophy:
    - Per-book calculation: Prevents one profitable book from masking losses elsewhere
    - Inactive book tolerance: Miners can focus on subset of books without penalty
    - Excess inactive penalty: Too many inactive books dilute the score toward 0.0
    - Median aggregation: Robust to outliers, represents "typical" book performance
    - Consistent with Kappa: Both use per-book → median with inactive tolerance
