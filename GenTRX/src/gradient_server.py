"""GenTRX gradient exchange — event-driven aggregation server.

HTTP endpoints:
  POST /gentrx/state                  — receive sim state ticks from validator
  GET  /gentrx/assignment?miner_uid=N — fetch assignment for a miner
  GET  /gentrx/version                — check current model version
  GET  /gentrx/scores?since_round=N   — poll latest scores
  GET  /gentrx/metrics                — Prometheus metrics (scrape target for Grafana)

Two bucket types, each committed on-chain (state arrives over HTTP — no state bucket):
  - Validator bucket (GENTRX_VALIDATOR_S3_*): checkpoints/ + data/ + proposals/
  - Per-miner buckets (GENTRX_AGENT_S3_*): gradients/ — one per miner

Run standalone:
    python -m GenTRX.src.gradient_server \\
        --checkpoint $REPO/checkpoints/GenTRX/best.pt \\
        --val-data $REPO/data/server \\
        --subtensor-network local --netuid 1

All filesystem paths are resolved to absolute at construction. Pass
absolute paths or `$VAR`-expanded paths to keep the invocation
independent of the launching shell's CWD.
