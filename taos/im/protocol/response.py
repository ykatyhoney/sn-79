        Add a market order instruction to the agent response.

        Args:
            book_id (UInt32): The ID of the order book to place the market order in.
            direction (OrderDirection): Direction of the order (OrderDirection.BUY or OrderDirection.SELL).
            quantity (float): Size of the order in `currency`.
            delay (int, optional): Delay in simulation nanoseconds which must elapse before the instruction is processed at the exchange. 
                                This delay will be added to the delay calculated based on your response time to the validator.
                                Defaults to 0.
            clientOrderId (UInt32 | None, optional): Optional client-specified order ID for tracking.
            stp (STP, optional): Self-trade prevention strategy (`STP.NO_STP`, `STP.CANCEL_OLDEST`, `STP.CANCEL_NEWEST`, `STP.CANCEL_BOTH` or `STP.DECREASE_CANCEL`). 
                                Defaults to STP.CANCEL_OLDEST.
            currency (OrderCurrency, optional): Currency to use for the order quantity (OrderCurrency.BASE or OrderCurrency.QUOTE). 
                                If set to `OrderCurrency.QUOTE`, the `quantity` will be interpreted as the amount of QUOTE currency that the agent wishes to exchange.
                                The matching engine at the simulator will determine the corresponding BASE amount to assign based on the asset price at the time of execution.
                                Defaults to BASE.
            leverage (float, optional): Leverage multiplier to apply to the order. The effective order quantity will be `(1+leverage)`
                                e.g. an order placed for 1.0 BASE with 0.5 leverage will be placed for a total quantity of 1.5 BASE, where 0.5 is borrowed from the exchange.
                                Must be non-negative. Defaults to 0.0 (no leverage).
            settlement_option (LoanSettlementOption | int, optional): Strategy for settling outstanding margin loans using the proceeds of this order. Options:
                                LoanSettlementOption.NONE : No loan repayments
                                LoanSettlementOption.FIFO : Loans will be repaid, starting from the oldest
